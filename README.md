# Transit.io - Distributed Transit Payment System

Original Repo link: https://github.com/jleibovitch/distributed-systems-final

Link to the Report: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t3wylBagI0dC_3NxD9Jm4UJ-dY3s_oQ9ynmPGFEy3e0/edit?usp=sharing

Link to code I have contributed (webserver): https://github.com/jleibovitch/distributed-systems-final/tree/main/web_server/server

### Relevant skills I demonstrated in this project:

- Ability to use Python Flask in a variety of ways including Flask-Login, Flask-WTF (forms) and Flask-Bcrypt (Hashing)
- Creating a Database and table using SQL Alchemy and integrating it with Flask
- Receive incoming requests from an external api to store and update information within user tables

### Brief Summary:
This project is a distributed account-based transit payment system that intends to allow users to pay for transit fares via a card tap or using the NFC feature on smartphones. We utilize a multi-layered architecture with a centralized server, creating a distributed system that serves users from multiple locations and stations. (More details in the report)

# Github Stats

Original Repo link: https://github.com/a-saf/SOFE3700-GitHubStats

Link to the Report: https://github.com/a-saf/SOFE3700-GitHubStats/blob/master/phase%203%20-%20report%20.pdf


### Relevant skills I demonstrated in this project:

- Used MySQL Workbench to create a database and tables from scratch
- Pppulated the database and tables with real data from the Gitub API
- Connected the Database to our web application with XAMPP and PHP
- Created 10 Distinct Views including complex views such as various types of Joins & Nested Queries
- Used Javascript to create visual charts

### Brief Summary:

Github provides some general statistics on individual repository pages but currently there is no convenient way to look at real-time commit statistics across repositories of different users at a glance. The goal of this project is to create a simple database web application that will query, store, analyze and render current GitHub commit statistics using GitHub public REST API. The application will focus on sorting and pulling commit statistics from public repositories of users located in Ontario, Canada. This data will be analyzed for the following metrics: which months and days of the week and hours of the day have the most commits, most commonly used programming languages, and the categories of software products these commits represent.
